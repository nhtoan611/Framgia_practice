  # Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
  # and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
  # than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
  #
  # To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
  #
  #     I18n.t 'hello'
  #
  # In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
  #
  #     <%= t('hello') %>
  #
  # To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
  #
  #     I18n.locale = :es
  #
  # This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
  #
  # To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
  # available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.
